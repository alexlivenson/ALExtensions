# Installation
### Carthage
Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with Homebrew using the following command:

```
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```
To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your Cartfile:
```
github "alexlivenson/ALExtensions" ~> 1.0
```
Run carthage update to build the framework and drag the built ALExtensions.framework into your Xcode project.
